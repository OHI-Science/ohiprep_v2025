# Summary
This analysis converts FAO commodities data into data layers used to calculate OHI 2023 global coral harvest pressure.


## 2024 Updates from previous assessment
- New year of FAO data (1976-2022; new year 2022)
- Added code to remove flag column (was done inherently or upstream before)
- Built on programmatic year usage
- More updates to name_2_rgn
- Restructured file paths for cross-platform capability, primarily using `{here}` package
- Updated `raw/commodities2products.csv` to include new coral category
- Updated script to work with `janitor::clean_names()` instead of raw column names
- Updated `read.csv()` and `write.csv()` to `read_csv()` and `write_csv()` when appropriate

# 2023 Updates from previous assessment
- New 2 years of FAO data (1976-2021; new years 2020 and 2021)
- Added/edited code for the Datacheck section
- Added a tic/toc for timing purposes
- Added more programmatic year usage
- Swapped np_split_antilles for split_regions (more generalized usage)
- Updates to name_2_rgn reduce the code length of the Rmd
- Cleaned up code and comments

# Data Source

**Reference**:
    https://www.fao.org/fishery/statistics-query/en/trade
    App release date: March 2024
FAO raw commodities quantity 1976_2022
FAO raw commodities value 1976_2022
FAO raw commodities metadata found [here](https://www.fao.org/fishery/en/collection/global_commodity_prod) and overall FAO data directory found [here](https://www.fao.org/fishery/en/fishstat)

**Downloaded**: August 5, 2024

**Description**:  Quantity (tonnes) and value (USD) of raw commodities (Exports only) for each country, taxa, year. The FAO data is subset to include commodities in these categories: shells, corals, ornamental fish, fish oil, seaweed and plants, sponges (see: `raw/commodities2products.csv` for details).

**Time range**: 1976-2022


Flag codes:

E: Estimate
N: Not significant (below 0.5)
X: Value from international organization


**Summary of data layer from methodology**:
`hd_coral`

*Pressure*

**Category**: ecological

**Subcategory**: habitat destruction

>The total tonnes of coral harvest were determined for each region using export 
data from the FAO Global Commodities database. The tonnes of ornamental fishing 
was divided by the area of coral, taken from the hab_coral layer, to get the 
intensity of coral harvest per region. Following this, we set the reference 
value as the 95th quantile of coral harvest intensity. We then divided the 
intensity by the reference intensity. Anything that scored above 1 received a[n] 
intensity pressure score of 1. To incorporate the health of the coral, we then 
multiplied the intensity pressure score by the health of the coral, to get the 
final pressure score.


I think instead of ornamental fishing, it's tons of corals commodities

# these methods yield identical datasets

# Data Wrangle

Read in the tonnes and usd data that was completed in the Natural Products ornamentals dataprep (and above). Combining the quantity and value data and a bit of cleaning to remove data prior to first reporting year for coral commodities and regions. 
```{r, eval=FALSE}

# Gapfilling 

Summary of gapfilling that is performed:

  * Zero-fill: for observations with NAs for both values (tonnes & usd), fill both as zero. Also cross-fills zeros where one value is zero, other is NA.
  * Regression fill, first pass: Where enough non-zero paired observations exist at the country level, use country-level data to create regression models (tonnes ~ usd and vice versa) for gapfilling.  About 25% success. 
  * Regression fill, second pass: Where pass 1 failed, and enough non-zero paired observations exist at georegional level, use georegional-level data to create regression models (tonnes ~ usd + year, and vice versa) for gapfilling.  About 90% success. 
 * Regression fill third pass: Where passes 1 and 2 failed, use global-scale data to create  regression models (tonnes ~ usd + year, and vice versa) for gapfilling.  100% success.
 * End-fill:  For years where NAs still exist in final year, carry forward data from prior year (after other gapfilling techniques).

```{r, eval = FALSE}  
# Flag for gap-filling
h_gapflag <- h_clip %>% np_harvest_gapflag()
## Adds flag for required gap-filling, based upon NAs in data. 
## NOTE: Does not perform any gap-filling.
## At this point, h_gapflag includes: 
##    rgn_name   rgn_id   commodity   product   year   tonnes   usd   gapfill
## 'gapfill' will be in (zerofill, endfill, tbd, none)

data_check <- h_gapflag %>% np_datacheck()
## for each commodity within each region, creates (but doesn't save...) summary info:
##   num_years:        the length of the data series for this commodity in this region
##   usd_unique_nz:    (or 'tns') number of unique non-zero values for usd or tonnes 
##   usd_na & tns_na:  number of NA occurrences
##   paired_obs:       number of non-zero paired observations
##   usd_unique_pairs: (or 'tns') within set of paired observations, count of unique usd and tonnes
##   unique_pairs:     lesser of usd_unique_pairs and tns_unique_pairs
##   count_no_data:    number of paired NAs - years with no value reported

# Fill with zeroes when appropriate
h_zerofill <- h_gapflag %>% np_zerofill()
## for post-reporting years with NA for both tonnes and USD, fill zero - 
##    assumes that non-reporting indicates zero harvest to report.
## Also cross-fills zeros where one side is 0, other is NA (not flagged as gapfill)

h_lowdata_filter <- h_zerofill %>% np_lowdata_filter()
## Exclude commodities (within a region) that have few non-zero data points.
## Optional parameter with default: nonzero_h_yr_min = 4
## NOTE: This filter has consequences for the regression, but also has meaning in terms of 
##    not inflicting a penalty on regions trying, and then stopping, an experimental harvest.

## Melanie's script to add a georegional ID tag based on country keys and IDs.
h <- h_lowdata_filter %>% add_georegion_id()

# Gapfill quantity (tonnes) if value (usd) present based on model (tonnes ~ usd) or (tonnes ~ usd + year)
h <- h %>% np_regr_fill(years_back = 10, vars = 'td', scope = 'rgn_id')
h <- h %>% np_regr_fill(vars = 'tdy', scope = 'georgn_id')
h <- h %>% np_regr_fill(vars = 'tdy', scope = 'global')
## np_regr_fill() is a generalized regression gapfill function. Parameters (with defaults):
## * years_back=50 (int):    This determines how far back in the time series to include within the regression.
## * min_paired_obs=4 (int): This determines how many paired observations are required to attempt a regression.
## * scope = 'rgn_id' (str): ('rgn_id', 'georgn_id', 'global') Determines grouping scale for regression.
## * vars = 'tdy' (str):     ('td', 'tdy') Determines model: (tonnes ~ usd) or (tonnes ~ usd + year) [and vice versa]

# For final year of data, if both usd and tonnes originally reported as NA, pull forward values for usd and tonnes from the previous year. This should happen after regression fill.
h <- h %>% np_end_fill()


# Store commodity-level data, before moving on to the product-level smoothing.
h_comm <- h

## Output gapfilling report to .csv files.
## Very few usd gapfilling, and none in recent years (data used to weight contributions), so will ignore this: gapfill=="r2_u_gr"
h_gap <- h %>%
  dplyr::mutate(gapfill = ifelse(gapfill == "r2_u_gr", "none", gapfill)) %>% # focusing only on tonnes gapfilling
  dplyr::select(rgn_id, commodity, product, year, gapfill) %>%
  dplyr::filter(product == "corals")

#write.csv(h_gap, here(current_prs_folder, "output", "prs_coral_gf.csv"), row.names = FALSE, na = '')
readr::write_csv(h_gap, here(current_prs_folder, "output", "prs_coral_gf.csv"), na = '')

```

# Final Data Wranglng

## Summarize values

Summarize each product per country per year, e.g., all corals in Albania in 2011. And, do some error checking.
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Summarize each product per country per year
h_prod <- h_comm %>%
  dplyr::filter(product == "corals") %>%
  dplyr::group_by(rgn_name, rgn_id, product, year) %>%
  summarize(tonnes = sum(tonnes, na.rm = TRUE), 
            usd = sum(usd, na.rm = TRUE))
          
# Error-checking and table exports to see if there are duplicates
stopifnot(sum(duplicated(h_prod[ , c('rgn_id', 'product', 'year')])) == 0)
```

## Quick Data Check

Look at wide format with all commodities and product subtotal (where commodity column value is "Z_TOTAL"), compared with the input data prior to summing.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# wide format for tonnes
h_x_tonnes <- h_comm %>% 
  bind_rows(mutate(h_prod, commodity = 'Z_TOTAL')) %>%
  dplyr::select(rgn_name, rgn_id, commodity, product, year, tonnes) %>%
  dplyr::arrange(rgn_name, product, commodity, year) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = year, values_from = tonnes)

# wide format for usd
h_x_usd <- h_comm %>% 
  bind_rows(mutate(h_prod, commodity = 'Z_TOTAL')) %>%
  dplyr::select(rgn_name, rgn_id, commodity, product, year, usd) %>%
  dplyr::arrange(rgn_name, product, commodity, year) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = year, values_from = usd)

# Check a random country and commodity
australia <- h_x_usd %>% dplyr::filter(product == "corals", rgn_name == "Australia") 
australia ## perfect



# Can open up in Excel to compare subtotals per country-product-year
readr::write_csv(h_x_tonnes, here::here(current_int_folder, "coral_harvest_tonnes_wide.csv"), na = "NA")
readr::write_csv(h_x_usd, here::here(current_int_folder, "coral_harvest_usd_wide.csv"), na = "NA")
```


## Calculate Rolling Averages
Determine rolling averages for tonnes and USD in order to determine peak values.  This is based upon total harvests by product group, not individual commodity.  

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Find max year in the summarized data table
year_max <- max(h_prod$year)
# 2022 in v2024

# Determine rolling averages for tonnes and USD
roll_prod <- h_prod %>%
  dplyr::arrange(rgn_id, product, year) %>%
  dplyr::group_by(rgn_id, product) %>% # group by region and product
  # determine rolling averages for tonnes and USD
  dplyr::mutate(
    tonnes_rollmean = rollapply(tonnes, width = 4, FUN = mean, align = "right", partial = TRUE, na.rm = FALSE),
    usd_rollmean = rollapply(usd, width = 4, FUN = mean, align = "right", partial = TRUE, na.rm = FALSE)) %>%
  dplyr::rename(
    tonnes_orig = tonnes, # prevent overwriting of reported and gapfilled values
    usd_orig = usd) %>% # prevent overwriting of reported and gapfilled values
  dplyr::mutate(
    tonnes = ifelse(!is.na(tonnes_rollmean), tonnes_rollmean, tonnes_orig),
    usd = ifelse(!is.na(usd_rollmean), usd_rollmean, usd_orig)) %>%
  dplyr::select(rgn_id, rgn_name, product, year, tonnes, usd, tonnes_orig, usd_orig)

# check grouping status
#is.grouped_df(roll_prod)

readr::write_csv(roll_prod, here::here(current_int_folder, "tonnes_coral_harvest.csv"))
```

## Calculate pressure score
 - Divide the harvest by the area of coral and take the 95th quantile of harvest 
 - Anything above the 95th quantile recieves a pressure score of 1, otherwise what it was before. 
 - Multiply the pressure score by the health score to get the final pressure score.
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Read in production harvest data 
roll_prod <- readr::read_csv(here::here(current_int_folder, "tonnes_coral_harvest.csv"))

# check grouping status
#is.grouped_df(roll_prod)

# Read in coral extent data
