### Moving these data to Github

v2012 data from: Neptune/model/GL-NCEAS-Pressures_AlienInvasives
v2013 data from: Neptune/model/GL-NCEAS-Pressures_v2013a/data/p_sp_alien_2013a.csv

Data were disaggregated from 2012 to 2013, but I can't find the script.  According to supporting materials: "territories assigned value of administrative country weighted by relative proportions of EEZ area".  This seems correct.

I have added a script to indicate this gapfilling.
