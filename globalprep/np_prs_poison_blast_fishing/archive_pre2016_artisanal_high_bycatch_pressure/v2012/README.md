These are the data for high bycatch artisanal fishing.

The high bycatch were originally based on blast fishing data (although I think it should have included poison as well) that has not been updated since 2012.  These data were copied from this location: neptune_data:model/GL-NCEAS-Pressures_v2013a/data
