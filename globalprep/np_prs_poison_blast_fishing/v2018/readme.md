## Ocean Health Index 2018: Natural Product and Hard bottom habitat destruction pressure

THIS FOLDER WAS COPIED FORM: prs_fish/v2017.
In 2017 data from the source was updated indicating bycatch according to different gear types. For this year assesment we are updating our methods with this improved data. We use data form v2017 because it has the necesary information to calculate the corresponging pressures. This is not the case in the data downloaded in 2018.






There are two types of fishing pressure layers used in the Ocean Health Index - Commercial and Artisanal

The dataset `taxa_gear_types.csv` was created in the [Impact Acceleration repo](https://github.com/OHI-Science/impact_acceleration/tree/master/stressors/comm_fish). This dataset links each taxa and gear type in the SAUP dataset to our classifications:
- demersal destructive
- demersal nondestructive high bycatch
- demersal nondestructive low bycatch
- pelagic low bycatch
- pelagic high bycatch
