## Ocean Health Index Pressure: Coral Harvest

This folder describes the methods used to prepare data for the coral harvest pressure layer for OHI global. 

The folders in this file include the metadata, R scripts, and data for each assessment year (i.e., the year the assessment was conducted).  The most current year represents the best available data and methods, and previous years are maintained for archival purposes.

Our [data managment SOP](https://rawgit.com/OHI-Science/ohiprep/master/src/dataOrganization_SOP.html) describes how we manage OHI global data, including a description of the file structure.

Please see our [citation policy](https://oceanhealthindex.org/global-scores/data-download/) if you use OHI data or methods.

Thank you!
