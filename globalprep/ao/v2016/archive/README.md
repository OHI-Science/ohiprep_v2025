### Artisanal opportunities sustainability

The AO model has a sustainability component that is currently included in the model but set to one.  

We attempted to create a sustainability variable for each region based on fisheries data. Currently, there is too much uncertainty in the fisheries data and the results didn't fully make sense.

However, as fisheries data improves this would be a good approach.
