# process_WTTC.R
# Do not run stand-alone - source from main data_prep.R for TourismRecreation.
#
# Add rgn_ids for World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC)
# Previously had been named clean_WTTC.r (by JStewart May2013). This script created by JStewartLowndes Mar2014.
#
#   read in .xls files from the WTTC raw folder downloaded from www.wttc.org/research/economic-data-search-tool
#   data_prep.R. will reformat so that data aren't on every other line like the .xls table
#   files must be accessed to the same year (eg end year 2013, assuming all after that is projected)
#   adds identifier and units columns, and then runs add_rgn_id.r. 
#   no georegional gapfilling -- but save as separate files
