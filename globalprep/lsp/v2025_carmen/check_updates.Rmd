# Summary

***
Check outliers in output files from Lasting Special Places data prep and compare to Protected Planet's [monthly updates](https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/monthly-updates/) webpage. 

```{r}
major_changes <- read_csv("output/major_changes_2021.csv" ) #added this so I could come back to it without rerunning everything

```

## Bouvet Island +1.0:
 - Everything I can find suggests that this is and has been a fully protected nature preserve. 
 - It could be possible that in the past our models somehow were ignoring this place? 

#3 Mozambique +0.769:
 - This is taken from our data sources website, and suggests that the protected area in this region did grow, however I don't think it reflects that big of a growth...

 - According to our data source update, in December 2020, a protected area polygon was added. In November 2020, a polygon was updated.  
 - This seems to be a reversal of what was done last year. Last year Mozambique lost ~0.6 

## Russia +0.667:
 - At first glance, this one is a little puzzling... 
 - The chart here also doesn't reflect that big of growth:

 - And on the [country page for protected planet](https://www.protectedplanet.net/country/RUS), it indicates that 2.24% marine protected area coverage. Even with our 30% cut off, it would make Russia's score ~7.5% (similar to what it was in 2020). 
 - **HOWEVER, I just think that this graph hasn't been updated this year.... because [this](https://www.protectedplanet.net/en/resources/January-2021-update-of-the-wdpa-and-wd-oecm) lists the January 2021 update for the WDPA dataset, and Russia has the largest update (and its only update since 2003).** 
 - This update added 7695 polygons, and removed 2116 polygons. 

## Slovenia -0.494:
 - Their country page on protectedplanet shows this much coverage:

 - The August 2020 update of the dataset tells us that there were 172 polygons added, 305 polygons removed, and 870 polygons updated for Slovenia. **The removal of polygons is likely why their score has decreased.**

## India -0.218:
 - Their country page shows this much protected area:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33332753/107828783-68e26700-6d3e-11eb-96aa-e79aa56fa19a.png)
 - **The February 2021 update of the dataset shows that 346 polygons in India were removed.**

I feel pretty confident that these changes are not due to a screw up, and just changes in source data. Although the Bouvet Island one does confuse me.
