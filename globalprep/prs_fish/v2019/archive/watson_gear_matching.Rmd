This script assigns gear and species specific data to the raw data from [Watson (2017)](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201739) in order to classify catch as either **demersal** or **pelagic**, **destructive** or **nondestructive** and **high** or **low** bycatch. Using the gear classifications laid out in Halpern et al. (2008) Table S4, as well as species information from [FishBase](http://www.fishbase.org/search.php) shared by the [Sea Around Us Project](http://www.seaaroundus.org/) data we were able to assign gear classifications to each record.

Overview:

- Each data file provided by Watson was downloaded from [this website](http://metadata.imas.utas.edu.au/geonetwork/srv/eng/metadata.show?uuid=c1fefb3d-7e37-4171-b9ce-4ce4721bbc78) onto a server held at NCEAS
- After extracting all unique gear types found in the data, a *gear to category* dataset was created (`gear_to_cat.csv`) manually using information from Table S4 in Halpern et al. (2008), and joined to the raw data. This dataset added three new columns to the data; **bycatch** (high or low), **type** (pelagic or demersal), and **destruction** (destructive or nondestructive). 
- Not every gear type could be assigned a single value for each of these categories so additional information was required.
- The Sea Around Us Project has a taxon database for all species within their data, which is similar to the species in the Waston databases. The taxon database has information on **Functional Group** for each species, which was used to assign either *pelagic* or *demersal* to species without an assignment from the *gear_to_cat.csv* data.
- Remaining catch records with missing or mismatched information were cleaned by hand which is detailed in this script.
- Final output is a dataset, `taxa_gear_types.csv` that assigns each taxa+gear type to the categories used to create the five fishing stressors.

# Get gear types from raw data

Read in one of the raw data files from Watson (2017) and look at the unique gear types.

```{r raw_data_files}

raw <- readRDS(file.path(dir_M,'git-annex/impact_acceleration/stressors/comm_fish/data/catch/CatchPublic1014.rds'))

#look at all the unique gear types

gear <- raw %>%
          dplyr::select(Gear,GearName)%>%
          unique()

DT::datatable(gear,rownames = F)
```

![](figs/GearTypeClassifications.png)

The bycatch, type and destruction information was manually added for each gear type using figure S4 from Halpern (2008). Some I left blank as I don't know if they are demersal or pelagic. This information was saved in `gear_to_cat.csv`.


```{r}

gear_cat <- read_csv('gear_to_cat.csv')

DT::datatable(gear_cat,rownames = F)

```

# Assign gear categories to data

Since we are just focusing on assigning gear types to the catch records we can eliminate some of the columns from the raw dataset and select unique records for Taxonkey, TaxonName, CommonName, Gear, GearName.

```{r}

data <- raw%>%
        dplyr::select(Taxonkey,TaxonName,CommonName,Gear,GearName)%>%
        unique()%>%
        left_join(gear_cat,by = c("Gear","GearName"))

DT::datatable(head(data,n=50),rownames = F)

```

# Assign species type categories

We still have a lot of records that need further clarification with regards to type of species (demersal or pelagic) since the GearName itself does not distinguish between these two. We can use species data from the Sea Around Us Project to assign each species to the categories "demersal" or "pelagic". The `taxon.dat` data provided by SAUP for the OHI 2016 assessment contains information on **Functional Group** which can be used to categorize species.

```{r saup_taxon_data}

dt_taxon           <- fread(file.path(dir_M,'git-annex/globalprep/_raw_data/SAUP/d2016/Data/SeaAroundUs/taxon.dat'), sep=";", header = FALSE)
colnames(dt_taxon) <- c("TaxonKey","Scientific_Name","Common_Name","FunctionalGroupDescription")
setkey(dt_taxon,TaxonKey)

DT::datatable(head(dt_taxon),rownames = F)
```

First we can combine the Functional Group description data with our catch dataset
```{r}

catch_df_taxa <-data%>%
                dplyr::select(TaxonKey = Taxonkey, TaxonName,CommonName)%>%
                unique()%>%
                left_join(dt_taxon,by='TaxonKey')

nas <- filter(catch_df_taxa,is.na(Common_Name))
```

Looks like we have just `r nrow(nas)` that don't match, we could easily assign these manually

Sticking with the `catch_df_taxa dataset`, lets create new columns that tease out the type of species either demersal or pelagic using the `stringr` package function, `str_detect`. Here we assign the *pelagic* category to all records which have a Functional Group Description containing: "shark", "ray", "reef", "pelagic", "Krill", and "Cephalopods". We assign the *demersal* category to all records that contain: "Shrimp", "crab","lobster","demersal",or "flatfish" in the Functional Group Description.

Let's add this back into the `catch_df_taxa` data. will also have to manually add in the type for the 19 missing ones. 

The manual assignment of demersal or pelagic is based on my (Jamie's) knowledge of these organisms. The assignments are fairly obvious except for "Marine animals". For this group I have assigned them to the 'pelagic' category, with the justification that 'pelagic' might be more encompassing than 'demersal'.

```{r}

catch_df_taxa <- catch_df_taxa%>%
                  mutate(type = ifelse(str_detect(FunctionalGroupDescription, "shark|ray|reef|pelagic|Krill|Cephalopods"), "pelagic", ifelse(str_detect(FunctionalGroupDescription, "Shrimp|crab|lobster|demersal|flatfish"),"demersal", NA)))%>%
                  mutate(type = ifelse(str_detect(CommonName, 'Tuna|Shark|sharks|Herring|Corvina|Cartilaginous fishes|animals'),'pelagic',                                  ifelse(str_detect(CommonName,'decapods|cucumbers|cockles|Mollusca|molluscs|Sea stars|Starfishes|lobster|urchins'),'demersal',type)))

DT::datatable(catch_df_taxa,rownames = F)

```

Add taxonomic info back to the dataset. Now we have two different ways of categorizing each species, the first was by gear type and the second by functional group. We need to check and make sure these line up.

```{r}
data_plus_gear_info <- data%>%
                        rename(TaxonKey = Taxonkey)%>%
                        left_join(catch_df_taxa,by = c('TaxonKey','CommonName','TaxonName'))%>%
                        dplyr::select(-Common_Name,-Scientific_Name)%>%
                        mutate(diff = ifelse(type.x == type.y,1,0))

```

Do the two types match up? type.x is the type assigned to the gear, type.y is the type assigned to the species

```{r}

mismatch <- data_plus_gear_info%>%
      filter(diff != 1)%>%
      dplyr::select(CommonName,GearName,bycatch,type.x,type.y,destruction,diff)%>%
      unique()

DT::datatable(mismatch,rownames = F)

```

It looks like there are `r nrow(mismatch)` cases where we have mismatched types. After looking at it, it's complicated. What I propose is that when the gear says it is either a bottom trawl, trammel, or trap, it is demersal. If it is a mid-water trawl it is pelagic. All species in here that were assigned the "by diving" gear were pelagic. There was one spear & lance species (Moray eel) so it's assigned demersal.

```{r}
mismatch_fix <- mismatch%>%
  mutate(true_type = ifelse(str_detect(GearName,'bottom trawls|spear|trap|explosives|beach')|str_detect(CommonName, 'crab|shrimp|lobster|lizardfish|prawn|Cods|crustaceans|guitarfish|squillid|moray|Lizard'),'demersal',
                 ifelse(str_detect(GearName,'mid-water|set|diving'),'pelagic','pelagic')))

```

Now join `mismatch_fix` (the fixed records) back to the dataset.

```{r}

df_type_dest <- data_plus_gear_info%>%
              left_join(mismatch_fix,by = c('CommonName','GearName','bycatch','type.y','type.x','destruction','diff'))%>%
              rowwise()%>%
              mutate(fish_type = ifelse(diff==1|is.na(diff), type.y,true_type))%>%#if the types match, assign it that type. if diff is NA, this means type.x is na so assign type.y, otherwise it should have true_type already defined
              dplyr::select(-type.x,-type.y,-true_type,-diff)

```

We have assigned each gear & species combination to either the *pelagic* or *demersal* category as well as destruction (non-destructive or destructive) but there are still gear types that do not have a bycatch assigned, specifically two types of gear, **without gear** and **Lines**. Again we can rely on table S4 from Halpern et al. (2008) and assign **Lines**, which are all for pelagic species, to "low bycatch". We are also assigning **without gear** to be low bycatch since many of these are hand collection.

```{r}

DT::datatable(df_type_dest%>%
                filter(is.na(bycatch)),rownames = F)

```

The final dataset that matches each unique gear & taxon from the raw Watson data to the information we will use to map each of the 5 catch layers is saved as `taxa_gear_types.csv`

```{r assign_bycatch, eval=FALSE}

final_df <- df_type_dest%>%
            mutate(bycatch = ifelse(is.na(bycatch),'low',bycatch))

write.csv(final_df,'taxa_gear_types.csv')

```
