## Ocean Health Index: Mariculture (MAR) (Subgoal of food provisioning goal)

This folder describes the methods used to prepare data for the mariculture subgoal for the global OHI assessment.

More information about this goal is available [on OHI-Science.org](https://oceanhealthindex.org/images/htmls/Supplement.html#66_Food_Provision).

The folders in this file include the metadata, R scripts, and data for each assessment year (i.e., the year the assessment was conducted). The most current year represents the best available data and methods, and previous years are maintained for archival purposes.

Our [data managment SOP](https://rawgit.com/OHI-Science/ohiprep/master/src/dataOrganization_SOP.html) describes how we manage OHI global data, including a description of the file structure.

Please see our [citation policy](https://oceanhealthindex.org/global-scores/data-download/) if you use OHI data or methods.

Thank you!
