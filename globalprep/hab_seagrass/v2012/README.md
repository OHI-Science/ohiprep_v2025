## Ocean Health Index: Seagrass data for the habitat subgoal, coastal protection goal, and carbon storage goal

This folder includes the extent, health, and trend data for seagrass. These data have not been updated since the 2012 assessment because no suitable updates are available. We explored new data sources (hab_seagrass/v2016_explore) but were not able to improve the data.
