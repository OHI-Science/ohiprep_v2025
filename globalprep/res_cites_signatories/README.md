## Ocean Health Index: Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) signatories

This folder has data for the signatories of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). These data are used to calculate resilience.

The folders in this file include the metadata, R scripts, and data for each assessement year (i.e., the year the assessment was conducted).  The most current year represents the best available data and methods, and previous years are maintained for archival purposes.

Our [data managment SOP](https://rawgit.com/OHI-Science/ohiprep/master/src/dataOrganization_SOP.html) describes how we manage OHI global data, including a description of the file structure.

Please see our [citation policy](http://ohi-science.org/citation-policy/) if you use OHI data or methods.

Thank you!
