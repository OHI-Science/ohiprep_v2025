### Notes for future analyses
(Sep 25 2016)

These paths will need to be changed in the R scripts for future analyses with these data:

The raw data that relate to this were moved from: mazu:git-annex/globalprep/coastal_population 
to:
mazu:git-annex/globalprep/_raw_data/CIESEandCIAT_population/d2015

The intermediate data generated by the scripts here were moved from: mazu:git-annex/globalprep/coastal_population/v2015/int
to:
mazu:git-annex/globalprep/mar_prs_population/v2015/int
