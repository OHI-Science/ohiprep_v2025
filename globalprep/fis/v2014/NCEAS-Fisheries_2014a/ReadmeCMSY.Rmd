#used for b_bmsy_lyr in: FIS goal and NP goal (fishoil)

The original CMSY code (by Coilin and Kristin) was modified, eliminating the constraints on the final biomass prior, so that:

finalbio    <- if(ct[nyr]/max(ct) > 0.5) {c(0.3,0.7)} else {c(0.01,0.4)}

was replaced with a uniform prior:

finalbio    <- c(0.01,0.7) 

Or to have an intermediate (relaxed) prior:

finalbio    <- if(ct[nyr]/max(ct) > 0.5) {c(0.4,0.8)} else {c(0.01,0.8)}

This removed the bimodal distribution of results, where many stocks had very low, or very high b_bmsy.

An additional custimization that can be done, at least when not running on mutiple cores (i.e. mpi wrapper removed) is to include resilience parameters - in the PARAMETERS section, replace:

start_r     <- c(0.01,10)  ## disable this line if you use resilience

with 

  if(res == "Very low"){
    start_r  <- c(0.015, 0.1)
  } else { 
    if(res == "Low"){
      start_r  <- c(0.05,0.5)
    } else { 
      if(res == "High"){
        start_r  <- c(0.6,1.5)   
      } else {
        start_r  <- c(0.1,1)
      }
    }
  }
