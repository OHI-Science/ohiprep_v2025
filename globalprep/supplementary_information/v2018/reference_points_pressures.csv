"Ocean Acidification","2011-2015","Aragonite saturation state","Threshold and change","N/A","<=1",NA,NA,"aragonite saturation state","An aragonite saturation state less than or equal to 1 is widely recognized as undersaturated and can be attributed as a threshold for acidification globally. For regions that are greater than 1, values are rescaled according to their amount of change compared to historical values"
"Sea Level Rise","1993-2015","Mean Sea Level Anomaly (MSLA) as compared to a 20 year mean (meters)","99.99 quantile across full time range","N/A","0.335938483476639",-0.93985,0.51,"meters","Annual means are aggregated from monthly data. No need for a historical comparison since the data comes computed against a 20 year mean."
"Ultraviolet Radiation Anomalies","2005 - 2015","Number of positive anomalies compared to historical reference","99.99 quantile","N/A","41",-43,50,"number of anomalous weeks in a year","Reference point is the 99.99th quantile of the differences in anomalies between historical and recent years"
"Sea Surface Temperature","1982 - 2012","Number of positive anomalies (weekly data from 1982-2012), defined as number >1sd from historical mean (1985-1989)","99.99 quantile across full time range","N/A","128",-133,164,"number of anomalous weeks in 5 yr period","historical data was selected to avoid el nino years"
