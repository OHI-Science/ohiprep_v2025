We extracted the number of non-native species from Molnar et al. (2008),
reported for each MEOW region (Spalding et al. 2007).  We then allocated
the number of non-native species to each OHI region by how much of the
given ecoregion fell within the OHI region. The pressures score is then
the sum of all the allocated non-native species in each OHI region.
