## Ocean Health Index: Tidal flat data for the habitat subgoal and carbon storage goal

This folder includes the extent, health, and trend data for tidal flat. 

More information about the goals is available:
* [habitat subgoal/biodiversity goal](http://ohi-science.org/goals/#biodiversity)
* [carbon storage](http://ohi-science.org/goals/#carbon-storage)

The folders in this file include the metadata, R scripts, and data for each assessment year (i.e., the year the assessment was conducted).  The most current year represents the best available data and methods, and previous years are maintained for archival purposes.

Our [data managment SOP](https://rawgit.com/OHI-Science/ohiprep/master/src/dataOrganization_SOP.html) describes how we manage OHI global data, including a description of the file structure.

Please see our [citation policy](http://ohi-science.org/citation-policy/) if you use OHI data or methods.

Thank you!
