## Ocean Health Index: Weighting file templates for habitats

This folder includes templates for the weighting files used to weight the pressure/resilience components for the habitat, coastal protection, and carbon storage goals.  They are blank because the data is generated in ohi-global/eez/conf/functions.R

Our [data managment SOP](https://rawgit.com/OHI-Science/ohiprep/master/src/dataOrganization_SOP.html) describes how we manage OHI global data, including a description of the file structure.

Please see our [citation policy](http://ohi-science.org/citation-policy/) if you use OHI data or methods.

Thank you!
