## Ocean Health Index: Blast and poison fishing for natural products goal (risk variable) and two pressures

This folder describes the methods used to prepare blast and poison fishing data. These data are used in the natural products goal (as a risk variable) and for artisanal high bycatch and hard bottom habitat destruction pressures.

More information about the natural products goal is available [here](http://ohi-science.org/goals/#natural-products).

The folders in this file include the metadata, R scripts, and data for each assessement year (i.e., the year the assessment was conducted).  The most current year represents the best available data and methods, and previous years are maintained for archival purposes.

Our [data managment SOP](https://rawgit.com/OHI-Science/ohiprep/master/src/dataOrganization_SOP.html) describes how we manage OHI global data, including a description of the file structure.

Please see our [citation policy](http://ohi-science.org/citation-policy/) if you use OHI data or methods.

Thank you!
