# Summary

This analysis converts FAO commodities data into data layers used to calculate OHI `r format(Sys.time(), "%Y")` global natural products scores. We will conduct this data prep on the commodities seaweed, fish oil, and ornamentals, so that we can produce \$ values for weighting later on.

# Updates from previous assessment

### v2024
*   Complete overhaul of methodology from previous years. Original data prep file: `STEP1a_np_ornamental_prep.Rmd`
*   New year of FAO data (2022)\
*   Updated links to datasets\
*   Updated file paths to be more reproducible, enable cross-platform capability (not dependent on direction of directory separator)
*   Updated data cleaning to follow tidyverse style, use of `janitor::clean_names()`
*   Updated `read.csv` and `write.csv` to `read_csv` and `write_csv` 
*   Updated `fao_fxn.R` to use `str_detect("...")` instead of `value == "..."` to properly replace FAO "missing value" codes with `NA`s. 
*   Added extra `0 --> NA` correction for specific conditions where this is appropriate (before gapfilling). See section: [Add FAO-zero-correction]

### v2023
New year of FAO data (2021). Replaced deprecated functions (`replace_at()`, `spread()`, `gather()`)

**Description**: Quantity (tonnes) and value (USD) of raw commodities (Exports only) for each country, taxa, year. The FAO data is subset to include commodities in these categories: ornamental fish, fish oil, seaweed and plants (see: raw/commodities2products_weighting.csv for details).

**Time range**: 1976-2022

# New Methods Outline


STEP 1: Value data (used for weighting)

FAO commodities data -- filter the ornamentals, non-food seaweeds (agar and nonfood), and fofm. Summarize to get one tonnes value and one USD value for each category. Gapfill missing data using the relationship between USD ~ tonnes (and vice versa). Save these data as `np_harvest_usd_tonnes_gf.csv` to the `int` folder. 

Then calculate for each country:

USD per tonne for FOFM and non-food seaweeds (and ornamentals) to use for calculating weights in the new Step 5. Save these data as `np_usd_per_tonne.csv` to the `int` folder.

## Import Raw Data: FAO Commodities

Simultaneously read and process FAO commodities value and quantity data.

```{r}
## NOTE: This can be run as a loop, but the "value" and "quant" datasets need to be run individually to make sure
##  there are no problems (after this check, they can be looped for efficiency)

## Wrangle Data

Combining the quantity and value data and a bit of cleaning to remove data prior to first reporting year for each commodity and region.

```{r}
# Read in quant dataset from intermediate folder
h_tonnes <- read_csv(here(current_np_dir, "int", "tonnes.csv"))

# Read in value dataset from intermediate folder
h_usd <- read_csv(here(current_np_dir, "int", "usd.csv"))

# concatenate h_tonnes and h_usd data
## h includes rgn_name, rgn_id, commodity, product, year, tonnes, usd.
h <- h_usd %>%
    full_join(h_tonnes, by = c('rgn_name', 'rgn_id', 'commodity', 'product', 'year')) %>%
    mutate(commodity = as.character(commodity)) %>%
    arrange(rgn_id, product, commodity, year) 

# clip out years prior to first reporting year, for each commodity per region
h <- h %>% np_harvest_preclip()


# save a file to use in our methods document 
readr::write_csv(h, here(current_np_dir, "int", "h_methods_sum.csv"))

# test <- h %>%
#   group_by(product) %>%
#   summarise(sum_tonnes = sum(tonnes, na.rm = TRUE),
#             sum_usd = sum(usd, na.rm = TRUE)) ## we will show this table in the methods doc

# ---- filter for our commodities of interest ----
h <- h %>%
    dplyr::filter(product %in% c("fish_oil", "ornamentals", "seaweeds")) 
```


### Add FAO-zero-correction

Some regions had 0 E and 0.00 (no "..." missing data flag) recorded for tonnes, but simultaneously had non-zero data for USD. 
Before gap-filling, we need to replace zeros with NAs in two cases:

    1.    When `tonnes` is equal to 0 and `usd` is not `NA` and `usd` is greater than 0
    
    2.    When `usd` is equal to 0 and `tonnes` is not `NA` and `tonnes` is greater than 0

```{r}
# replace certain zeros with NA to flag for gapfilling
h_zero_na <- h %>% 
  mutate(tonnes = ifelse(tonnes == 0 & !is.na(usd) & usd > 0, NA, tonnes)) %>% 
  mutate(usd = ifelse(usd == 0 & !is.na(tonnes) & tonnes > 0, NA, usd))


check_start <- max(h$year) - 5
check_stop <- max(h$year)

# check Singapore
h %>% filter(rgn_id == 208,
             year %in% (check_start:check_stop), # feel free to update dates
             product %in% c("ornamentals")) %>% 
  arrange(desc(year))

h_zero_na %>% filter(rgn_id == 208,
                     year %in% (check_start:check_stop),
                     product %in% c("ornamentals")) %>% 
  arrange(desc(year))

# nice!

```



### Gapfilling

Summary of gapfilling that is performed:

-   Zero-fill: for observations with NAs for both values (tonnes & usd), fill both as zero. Also cross-fills zeros where one value is zero, other is NA.
-   Regression fill, first pass: Where enough non-zero paired observations exist at the country level, use country-level data to create regression models (tonnes \~ usd and vice versa) for gapfilling. About 25% success.
-   Regression fill, second pass: Where pass 1 failed, and enough non-zero paired observations exist at georegional level, use georegional-level data to create regression models (tonnes \~ usd + year, and vice versa) for gapfilling. About 90% success.
-   Regression fill third pass: Where passes 1 and 2 failed, use global-scale data to create regression models (tonnes \~ usd + year, and vice versa) for gapfilling. 100% success.
-   End-fill: For years where NAs still exist in final year, carry forward data from prior year (after other gapfilling techniques).

```{r}

h <- h_zero_na %>% np_harvest_gapflag()
## Adds flag for required gap-filling, based upon NAs in data. 
## NOTE: Does not perform any gap-filling.
## At this point, h includes: 
##    rgn_name   rgn_id   commodity   product   year   tonnes   usd   gapfill
## 'gapfill' will be in (zerofill, endfill, tbd, none)

data_check <- h %>% np_datacheck()
## for each commodity within each region, creates (but doesn't save...) summary info:
##   num_years:        the length of the data series for this commodity in this region
##   usd_unique_nz:    (or 'tns') number of unique non-zero values for usd or tonnes 
##   usd_na & tns_na:  number of NA occurrences
##   paired_obs:       number of non-zero paired observations
##   usd_unique_pairs: (or 'tns') within set of paired observations, count of unique usd and tonnes
##   unique_pairs:     lesser of usd_unique_pairs and tns_unique_pairs
##   count_no_data:    number of paired NAs - years with no value reported

h <- h %>% np_zerofill()
## for post-reporting years with NA for both tonnes and USD, fill zero - 
##    assumes that non-reporting indicates zero harvest to report.
## Also cross-fills zeros where one side is 0, other is NA (not flagged as gapfill)

h <- h %>% np_lowdata_filter()
## Exclude commodities (within a region) that have few non-zero data points.
## Optional parameter with default: nonzero_h_yr_min = 4
## NOTE: This filter has consequences for the regression, but also has meaning in terms of 
##    not inflicting a penalty on regions trying, and then stopping, an experimental harvest.

## Melanie's script to add a georegional ID tag based on country keys and IDs.
h <- h %>%
  add_georegion_id()

h <- h %>% np_regr_fill(years_back = 10, vars = 'td', scope = 'rgn_id')
h <- h %>% np_regr_fill(vars = 'tdy', scope = 'georgn_id')
h <- h %>% np_regr_fill(vars = 'tdy', scope = 'global')
## np_regr_fill() is a generalized regression gapfill function. Parameters (with defaults):
## * years_back=50 (int):     This determines how far back in the time series to include within the regression.
## * min_paired_obs=4 (int):  This determines how many paired observations are required to attempt a regression.
## * scope = 'rgn_id' (str):  ('rgn_id', 'georgn_id', 'global') Determines grouping scale for regression.
## * vars = 'tdy' (str):      ('td', 'tdy') Determines model: (tonnes ~ usd) or (tonnes ~ usd + year) [and vice versa]

h <- h %>% np_end_fill()
## For final year of data, if both usd and tonnes originally reported as NA, pull forward
##    values for usd and tonnes from the previous year.  This should happen after regression fill.

h_comm <- h
## Store commodity-level data, before moving on to the product-level smoothing.

## Output gapfilling report to .csv files.
## Very few usd gapfilling, and none in recent years (data used to weight contributions), so will ignore this: gapfill=="r2_u_gr"
h_gap <- h %>%
  mutate(gapfill = ifelse(gapfill == "r2_u_gr", "none", gapfill)) %>%   # focusing only on tonnes gapfilling
  dplyr::select(rgn_id, commodity, product, year, gapfill)

h_gap_ornamentals <- h_gap %>%
  filter(product == "ornamentals")

# save record of gapfilling methods
readr::write_csv(h_gap, # not sure why this isn't h_gap_ornamentals when the file name specifies ornamentals... (legacy from old step 1a...)
                 here(current_np_dir, "output", "np_ornamentals_harvest_tonnes_gf.csv"), na = '')

```


### Summarize values

Summarize each product per country per year, e.g., all corals in Albania in 2011. And, do some error checking.

```{r}
# summarize product values per country per year
h_prod <- h_comm %>% # copy-on-modify triggered for h_comm (defined earlier)
  group_by(rgn_name, rgn_id, product, year) %>%
  summarize(tonnes = sum(tonnes, na.rm = TRUE), 
            usd = sum(usd, na.rm = TRUE))
          
## Error-checking and table exports to see if there are duplicates
stopifnot(sum(duplicated(h_prod[ , c("rgn_id", "product", "year")])) == 0)
```

### Output first primary Step 1 intermediate
At this point, the `h_prod` dataframe contains `rgn_name`, `rgn_id`, `product`, `year`, `tonnes`, and `usd`. 

To complete the first component of step 1 in Mel's new NP plan, we'll save these as `np_harvest_usd_tonnes_gf.csv` in the `int` folder. 


```{r}
# save data frame with gap-filled usd and tonnes for all products to int dir
readr::write_csv(h_prod, here::here(current_np_dir, "int", "np_harvest_usd_tonnes.csv"))

```



## Calculate USD per Tonne per product

USD per tonne for FOFM and non-food seaweeds (and ornamentals). Save these intermediate data as 


```{r}
usd_per_tonne <- h_prod %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  group_by(rgn_name, rgn_id, year, product) %>% 
  # calculate values ($/tonnes)
  dplyr::mutate(usd_per_tonne = (usd / tonnes)) %>%
  # replace infinite values (divide by 0) with NA
  mutate(usd_per_tonne = ifelse(usd_per_tonne == "Inf", NA, usd_per_tonne))
# note: 0/0 = NaN

# save data to int dir
readr::write_csv(usd_per_tonne, here(current_np_dir, "int", "np_usd_per_tonne.csv"))

```
