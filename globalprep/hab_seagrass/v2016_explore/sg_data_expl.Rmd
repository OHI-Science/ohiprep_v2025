# Seagrass-related goals overview

**Habitat subgoal:**

Status was assessed as the average of the condition estimates for each *k* habitat present in a region (*C~k~*; measured as the loss of habitat and/or % degradation of remaining habitat), such that:

$$x_{HAB} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{k}C_k}{k}$$

where *C~k~* = *C~c~/C~r~* and *C~c~* is the current condition and *C~r~* is the reference condition specific to each *k* habitat present in the region.

**Carbon Storage:**

As with other goals that rely on habitats for Status, we measured the Status of Carbon Storage (*x~CS~*) as a function of its current ‘condition’ (*C~c~*) relative to a reference condition (*C~r~*) and a variable that weights the relative contribution of each habitat type (*k*) to total carbon storage, measured as the amount of area each habitat covers (*A~k~*) relative to the total area covered by all three habitats (*A~T~*) given the available data. See biodiversity goal (section 6J) for details on how habitat data were processed. Although Carbon sequestration rates and storage capacity can vary among the three habitats, value are similar enough across habitats and vary enough geographically within habitats that we assumed equal potential value for each. Thus, Status is:

$$x_{CS} = \sum_{i=1}^{k}\left(\frac{C_c}{C_r} * \frac{A_k}{A_T}\right)$$

**Coastal Protection:**

The Status of this goal (*x~CP~*) was calculated to be a function of the amount and/or condition of marine habitat(s) relative to their reference states and the ranked protective ability of each habitat type, such that:

$$x_{CP} = \sum_{i=1}^{k}\left(\frac{C_c}{C_r} * \frac{w_k}{w_{max}} * \frac{A_k}{A_T}\right)$$

where *C* is the condition at current (*c*) and reference (*r*) time points, and w is the rank weight of the protective ability, and *A* is the area within an EEZ for each *k* habitat type, proportional to either the maximum (*max*) ranks of any habitats present or total (*T*) current amount of all protective habitats.

# Some possible directions?

Seagrass presence:

* Type of seagrass is not important; breakdown of seagrass types by bioregion should be adequate?
* Aquamaps with a high threshold can provide distribution of seagrass habitat within EEZs - good *habitat* but not necessarily *presence*
* Can we determine a notion of presence per habitat?  Can Short data give us something here?
* WCMC data - correlate WCMC polygons to Aquamaps preferred habitat?  Still pretty sample-biased

Seagrass health (trend):

* Regression by bioregion, using all sites within bioregion to estimate

Model: seagrass habitat = presence (from Aquamaps etc) * health (from trend data); for countries with multiple sites, 

## Waycott data

For each site, time series of area (in hectares).  No species info.  Use `biorgn` to correlate changes in patch health to specific bioregions.  Perhaps use `area_cat` or `max(area_ha)` as part of a regression?  

`site_id | site_name | biorgn | rgn | yr_start | yr_end | area_cat | change_rate | year | area_ha | pub`

`change_rate` is specific rate of change, calculated over time interval, *t*, from the initial to final reported areas (*A~o~* and *A~t~*, respectively) as     [*ln(A~t~ / A~o~)/t*] * 100.


``` {r waycott_data, echo = FALSE}
data_waycott_file <- file.path(dir_data1, 'data_waycott.csv')

if(!file.exists(data_waycott_file)) {
  library(xlsx)

           site_name   = Site.Name, 
           biorgn      = Global.Seagrass.Bioregion, 
           rgn         = Country, 
           yr_start    = Yr.study.started,
           yr_end      = Yr.study.ended,

  write.csv(waycott_df, data_waycott_file, row.names = FALSE)
}

waycott_df <- read.csv(data_waycott_file, stringsAsFactors = FALSE) %>% unique()

waycott_df_mdl <- waycott_df %>%
  group_by(site_name) %>%
  do(mdl = lm(area_ha ~ year, data = .)) %>%
  mutate(lm_int   = round(mdl[['coefficients']][1], 3),

## Short data

For each site, time series of coverage (mean and sd), but no area relationship.  Could correlate changes in patch coverage to bioregions if a spatial bioregion map were available.

`site_name | date | time | year | sg_pct_mean | sg_pct_sd | lat | long | day | country`

``` {r short_data, echo = FALSE}
data_short_file   <- file.path(dir_data1, 'data_short.csv')

  library(xlsx)
  library(lubridate)
  
  short_df <- read.xlsx(file.path(dir_data0, 'allseagrass_09022011.xlsx'), sheetName = "ShortData")
  names(short_df) <- tolower(names(short_df))
  short_df <- short_df %>%
    rename(site_name   = location,
           sg_pct_mean = mean_seagr,
           sg_pct_sd   = std_seagra,
           lat         = dd_lat,
           long        = dd_lon) %>%
    mutate(day = yday(as.Date(date, '%m/%d/%y')))
  
  short_locs <- read.xlsx(file.path(dir_data0, 'allseagrass_09022011.xlsx'), sheetName = "SeagrassData") %>%
    filter(str_detect(tolower(Source), 'short')) %>%
    select(country, site_name = Region.Site.Name) %>%
    unique()
  
  short_df <- short_df %>%
    left_join(short_locs, by = 'site_name')

DT::datatable(short_df %>% select(site_name, country, year, yr_day = day, sg_pct_mean, sg_pct_sd, lat, long),
              caption = 'Short seagrass coverage data over time')
```
