## Ocean Health Index 2017: Fishing Pressures

There are two types of fishing pressure layers used in the Ocean Health Index - Commercial and Artisanal

The dataset `taxa_gear_types.csv` was created in the [Impact Acceleration repo](https://github.com/OHI-Science/impact_acceleration/tree/master/stressors/comm_fish). This dataset links each taxa and gear type in the SAUP dataset to our classifications:
- demersal destructive
- demersal nondestructive high bycatch
- demersal nondestructive low bycatch
- pelagic low bycatch
- pelagic high bycatch
