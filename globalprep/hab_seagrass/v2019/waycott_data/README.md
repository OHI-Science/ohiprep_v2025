## Ocean Health Index: Seagrass trend data for the habitat subgoal. 

This folder includes global trend data for seagrass habitat from Waycott et al. 2009. 

There are 5 different csv files in this folder. 

 -  'waycott_edited.csv' contains the data table from the Waycott paper. This contains seagrass data a per site, per year basis. 
    - Columns in this table are site _number, site_name, bioregion, country, start_year, end_year, area_cat, mu, year, and area. 
    - PDF formats of this can be found [here](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/suppl/2009/07/08/0905620106.DCSupplemental/ST1_PDF.pdf)
 - 'waycott_global_trends.csv' contains the data table which describes the global trends for seagrass found in Waycott et al. 2009. 
    - Columns in this table are years, median_mu, N, mean_mu, N, se_mu, net_area, avg_study_length.

The folders in this file include the metadata, R scripts, and data for each assessement year (i.e., the year the assessment was conducted).  The most current year represents the best available data and methods, and previous years are maintained for archival purposes.

Our [data managment SOP](https://rawgit.com/OHI-Science/ohiprep/master/src/dataOrganization_SOP.html) describes how we manage OHI global data, including a description of the file structure.

Please see our [citation policy](http://ohi-science.org/citation-policy/) if you use OHI data or methods.

Thank you!
