#### Exploration of SAUP data
The raw data was provided in early june.  I extracted the data tables from the database and saved them in the raw directory as csv files.

Our ability to use these data was limited by the fact that open seas data was not provided which is needed to calculate b/bmsy values.  For summary of analyses of these data, see issue: 478. 

These data have now been provided and I will save them in a raw2 directory.
