## Ocean Health Index: Land-based chemical pollution pressure data 

This folder describes the methods used to prepare data for land-based chemical pollution pressure for the global OHI assessment.  These data are used for the clean waters goal (3nm offshore and trend) and as a pressure.

More information about the clean waters goal is available [here](http://ohi-science.org/goals/#clean-waters).

More information about these data is available from:

The folders in this file include the metadata, R scripts, and data for each assessement year (i.e., the year the assessment was conducted).  The most current year represents the best available data and methods, and previous years are maintained for archival purposes.

Our [data managment SOP](https://rawgit.com/OHI-Science/ohiprep/master/src/dataOrganization_SOP.html) describes how we manage OHI global data, including a description of the file structure.

Please see our [citation policy](http://ohi-science.org/citation-policy/) if you use OHI data or methods.

Thank you!
