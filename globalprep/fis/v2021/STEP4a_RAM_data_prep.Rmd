# Summary

This script prepares the RAM B/Bmsy data:
1. Relevant data are collected from the RAM database
2. Missing years are gapfilled when appropriate
3. RAM and SAUP species names are harmonized in a few cases
4. RAM stocks are associated with the corresponding OHI and FAO regions


## Updates from previous assessment

Using new SAUP catch data and updated RAM data for 2021


***

## Obtain RAM B/Bmsy data

The data is stored as a relational database in an R object. Check that the names of each element have not changed from last year! Update as appropriate in the below list. 

The following tables are included (for full list, see loadDBdata.r in mazu):  

1. timeseries  
The time series data is a data frame containing all assessments conducted per stock with the following headers/columns:  
(1) assessid (2) stockid (3) stocklong (4) tsid (5) tsyear (6) tsvalue

2. bioparams  
The time series data is a data frame with parameter values for all stocks and assessments. It has the following headers/columns:  
(1) assessid (2) stockid (3) stocklong (4) bioid (5) biovalue (6) bioyear (7) bionotes  

3.  timeseries_values_views  
This stores the timeseries values, using the most recent assessment available, with timeseries type. The dataframe contains the following headers/columns: stockid, stocklong, year, TBbest, TCbest, ERbest, BdivBmsypref, UdivUmsypref, BdivBmgtpref, UdivUmgtpref, TB, SSB, TN, R, TC, TL, RecC, F, ER, TBdivTBmsy, SSBdivSSBmsy, NdivNmsy, FdivFmsy, ERdivERmsy, CdivMSY, CdivMEANC, TBdivTBmgt, SSBdivSSBmgt, NdivNmgt, FdivFmgt, ERdivERmgt, Cpair, TAC, Cadvised, survB, CPUE, EFFORT, and stocks along the rows.

4. timeseries_units_views  
This stores the timeseries units (or time series source for touse time series), with timeseries type. The dataframe contains the following headers/columns: stockid, stocklong, TBbest, TCbest, ERbest, BdivBmgtpref, UdivUmsypref, BdivBmgtpret, UdivUmgtpref, TB, SSB, TN, R, TC, TL, RecC, F, ER, TBdivTBmsy, SSBdivSSBmsy, NdivNmsy, FdivFmsy, ERdivERmsy, CdivMSY, CdivMEANC, TBdivTBmgt, SSBdivSSBmgt, NdivNmsy, FdivFmgt, ERdivERmgt, Cpair, TAC, Cadvised, survB, CPUE, EFFORT, and stocks along the rows

5. timeseries_id_views  
This stores the timeseries ids with timeseries id along the columns. The dataframe contains the following headers/columns: stockid, stocklong, TBbest, TCbest, ERbest, BdivBmsypref, UdivUmsypref, BdivBmgtpref, UdivUmgtpref, TB, SSB, TN, R, TC, TL, RecC, F, ER, TBdivTBmsy, SSBdivSSBmsy, NdivNmsy, FdivFmsy, ERdivERmsy, CdivMSY, CdivMEANC, TBdivTBmgt, SSBdivSSBmgt, NdivNmgt, FdivFmgt, ERdivERmgt, Cpair, TAC, Cadvised, survB, CPUE, EFFORT, and stocks along the rows.

6. bioparams_values_views

(assessid, stockid, stocklong, assessyear, scientificname, commonname, areaname, managementauthority, assessorfull, region, FisheryType, taxGroup, primary_FAOarea, primary_country) and stock by row.

10. tsmetrics
Contains metadata, with columns tscategory, tsshort, tslong, tsunitsshort, tsunitslong, tsunique.


For this data prep we primarily use and consult `timeseries_values_views`, `tsmetrics`, and `metadata`
```{r load_data, eval = FALSE}

load(file.path(dir_M, "git-annex/globalprep/_raw_data/RAM/d2021/RAMLDB v4.495/R Data/DBdata[asmt][v4.495].RData"))

ram_bmsy_new <- timeseries_values_views %>%

  ungroup() %>%
  distinct(stockid, max_year) %>%
  group_by(max_year) %>%
  summarise(n())

hist(test$max_year,breaks=17)

```

## Gapfill RAM data when there are missing years

For each stock: 
 - If you are upfilling you carry over the most recent years value (i.e. data only goes to 2016, you upfill 2017 and 2018 with the 2016 value)
 - If you are back filling, you backfill using the value of the oldest most recent year (i.e. you only have values for 2016, 2017, and 2018... you give 2005-2015 the 2016 value)
 - If you are in-between-filling, you use linear approximation (zoo::na.approx) (i.e. you have 2005-2010 and 2016-2018... fill in 2011-2015 using na.approx)
 - To be included in this carry-over type gapfilling you have to have a maximum year of 2010 or greater (regardless of the number of years of data... so if you only have 1 year of data, for 2010, then that gets carried over all the way to 2018, or vice-versa)

## Identify FAO and OHI regions for RAM stocks

Identify the FAO/OHI regions where each RAM stock is located (fao and ohi regions are assigned to RAM Data in [STEP4b_fao_ohi_rgns.Rmd](https://mazu.nceas.ucsb.edu/rstudio/files/github/ohiprep_v2021/globalprep/fis/v2021/STEP4b_fao_ohi_rgns.html). **Run fao_ohi_rgns.Rmd now.**


If there are many differences between RAM spatial file and RAM metadata, check the STEP4_fao_ohi_rgns.Rmd prep again. 


```{r final, eval = FALSE}

## Read in RAM spatial stocks file
ram_spatial <- read.csv("int/RAM_fao_ohi_rgns_final.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

ram_meta <- metadata %>% 
  dplyr::select(stockid, stocklong, scientificname)

setdiff(ram_spatial$stockid, ram_meta$stockid) # make sure all the spatial data has corresponding metadata (should be 0). It is not 0, probably because these are ones that have been removed from the RAM database since the 2017 assessment... delete these from the data frame below. 

# join with metadata to get scientific name
ram_spatial <- ram_spatial %>%
  dplyr::select(-stocklong) %>%
  left_join(ram_meta, by = c("stockid")) %>%
  rename(RAM_species = scientificname) %>%
  filter(!is.na(stocklong)) ## filtering out ones that didn't match above

setdiff(ram_spatial$stockid, ram_meta$stockid) # now it is 0
```

## Standardize species names

In most cases, the RAM and SAUP data use the same species names, but there are a few exceptions.  The following code identifies species in the RAM data that are not in the SAUP data. In these cases, different species names may be used (although not necessarily because some of the species may be present in RAM, but not SAUP, for other reasons). For these species, I used fishbase to explore synonyms and create a table to harmonize the RAM species names with the SAUP species names (saved as: int/RAM_species_to_SAUP.csv).

```{r name harmonize, eval = FALSE}
ram_bmsy_gf_final <- read_csv(file.path("int/ram_stock_bmsy_gf.csv"))

# get list of RAM species, scientific name
ram_sp <- ram_bmsy_gf_final %>%
  left_join(data.frame(metadata), by = "stockid") %>%
  dplyr::select(scientificname) %>%
  unique() %>%
  arrange(scientificname)


# SAUP species, sci name (read in the datatable that includes TaxonKey)
SAUP_sp <- read_csv(file.path(dir_M,'git-annex/globalprep/fis/v2021/int/stock_catch_by_rgn_taxa.csv')) %>% 
  dplyr::rename(SAUP_scientificname = TaxonName) %>%
  dplyr::select(SAUP_scientificname) %>%
  unique() %>%
  arrange(SAUP_scientificname)


# compare names - what's in RAM that's not in SAUP
tmp <- data.frame(scientificname = sort(setdiff(ram_sp$scientificname, SAUP_sp$SAUP_scientificname))) # 46 species names

# compare names - what's in SAUP that's not in RAM
tmp2 <- data.frame(scientificname = sort(setdiff(SAUP_sp$SAUP_scientificname, ram_sp$scientificname))) # 2069 species names.. unfortunately a lot.

write.csv(tmp, "int/unmatched_RAM_species.csv", row.names=FALSE)
write.csv(tmp2, "int/SAUP_species_no_RAM.csv", row.names=FALSE)

#setdiff(tmp, ram_name_corr$RAM_species)


## join ram spatial with RAM species on scientific name. We can use this to help check whether questionable species names across the ram and SAUP data match by region and fao id...
ram_sp_fao_ohi <- tmp %>%
  left_join(ram_spatial, by = c("scientificname" = "RAM_species")) %>%
  unique()

write_csv(ram_sp_fao_ohi, "int/new_ram_sp.csv")  

## get SAUP fao_ohi regions
SAUP_sp_fao_ohi <- read_csv(file.path(dir_M,'git-annex/globalprep/fis/v2021/int/stock_catch_by_rgn_taxa.csv')) %>% 
  dplyr::rename(SAUP_scientificname = TaxonName) %>%
   dplyr::filter(year > 1979) # %>%
  #filter(str_detect(SAUP_scientificname, "Lepidorhombus"))

RAM_species_to_SAUP <- read.csv("int/RAM_species_to_SAUP.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Then I hand-looked up each of the missing ones from "unmatched_RAM_species.csv", and added those new ones to "RAM_species_to_SAUP.csv" to generate this list - most still unmatched. See "RAM_species_to_SAUP_notes.csv" for our reasoning behind these changes. 

setdiff(tmp$scientificname, RAM_species_to_SAUP$SAUP_species) ## these are the new species to add to "RAM_species_to_SAUP.csv".

ram_name_corr <- read.csv("int/RAM_species_to_SAUP.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE) %>%
   filter(!is.na(SAUP_species))  # SAUP to RAM name conversion

ram_name_corr # matched species, unfortunately only 12
```


### Final formatting

Harmonize names between RAM and SAUP data.
```{r, eval=FALSE}

# correct names in a few cases to match with SAUP names
ram_name_corr <- read.csv("int/RAM_species_to_SAUP.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE) %>%
  filter(!is.na(SAUP_species)) # SAUP to RAM name conversion

ram_spatial <- ram_spatial %>%
  left_join(ram_name_corr, by="RAM_species") %>%
  dplyr::mutate(species = ifelse(!is.na(SAUP_species), SAUP_species, RAM_species)) %>%
  dplyr::select(rgn_id, fao_id, stockid, stocklong, species, RAM_area_m2)

length(unique(ram_spatial$stockid)) # 487 RAM stocks with B/Bmsy data - v2021
length(unique(ram_spatial$species)) #237
```


Re-name `stockid` column to `stockid_ram` and create new column `stockid` that matches with the `stockid` column in the CMSY data table prepared in [STEP3_calculate_bbmsy.Rmd](https://cdn.rawgit.com/OHI-Science/ohiprep_v2021/master/globalprep/fis/v2021/STEP3_calculate_bbmsy.html).
