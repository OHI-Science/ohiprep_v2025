""The principal product of Gracilaria is agar. "" ""Unknown quantities of Gracilaria are used in several places (e.g. Japan, China, Hawaii, St. Lucia) in the fresh vegetable market for human consumption. There, Gracilaria prices can be high (e.g. 5-7 USD /kg) although the volumes consumed are relatively low (e.g. a few tonnes per year)."" ""The use of Gracilaria as marine invertebrate feed has developed in Asia, especially in the fish pond system of Taiwan Province of China, leading to development of polycultures of Gracilaria and abalone which uses Gracilaria as the sole source of food of these gastropods. In the past the emphasis was to produce Gracilaria biomass for agar production. Now it is more profitable for the pond operators to supply their Gracilaria as fresh food to abalone farmers.""
